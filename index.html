      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        Our installation is meant to be exhibited in crowded exhibitions/spaces,
        where the audience wanders around, trying to find a moment of connection
        with a machine entity. Our work presents a moment of isolation and
        intimacy, where the individual spends time with the machine inside the
        black box, conversing and learning about each other and ultimately
        composing a piece together. The machine learning model reacts to human’s
        movements’ input and they both compose and harmonize a unique experience
        where the movement of the head notifies the machine of a sensory
        movement that requires sonic accompaniment. This immersive experience
        elevates a deeper understanding between the machine and the human, where
        they converse through methods other than just words and imperative
        functions.
      </p>

      <h2>Evaluation of Sensors</h2>
      <p>
        By using sensors, our project is transformed into an interactive space
        rather than just a visual, pre-defined experience. Depending on what
        sensors are used, they afford us the ability to customize the
        interaction and create a dynamic space, giving us the freedom to enhance
        user experience how we envision it. They support our proposed
        interaction design strategy, which is conversation between two learning
        systems, by creating the connection between the user and the machine.
        Without sensors, our two systems would not be able to communicate with
        each other, resulting in the failure of our goal.

        <a href="https://www.lozano-hemmer.com/pulse_topology.php"
          >Pulse Topology</a
        >
        is an immersive art installation consisting of thousands of light bulbs
        suspended at different levels. When participants walk below them, the
        lights flicker at different speeds which are in sync with the
        participants’ heartbeat. This creates a dynamic landscape that reflects
        how the people are feeling in that moment. With the use of custom
        heartbeat sensors, each new person’s pulse is added to a database and
        replaces older recordings.

        <a href="https://www.lozano-hemmer.com/cloud_display.php"
          >Cloud Display</a
        >
        is Rafael Lozano Hemmer’s work from 2019 in which he explores the
        relationship between spoken word communication and the formation of
        words on screens. He uses a vertical water fountain with 1600 ultrasonic
        atomizers that are controlled by a machine learning voice recognition
        system. Given the vaporizing effect of the words appearing and
        disappearing, he investigates the temporality of the language itself.

        Laetitia Sonami's
        <a href="https://sonami.net/portfolio/items/ladys-glove/"
          >Lady's Glove</a
        >
        is a pioneering electronic musical instrument that combines technology,
        performance art, and sound. It was created in the early 1990s and is a
        significant part of Sonami's avant-garde artistry. The Lady's Glove is a
        specialized glove fitted with sensors and electronic components. These
        sensors are strategically placed to detect the gestures and movements of
        the wearer's hand and fingers. The glove translates these movements into
        electronic signals that control various sound parameters, such as pitch,
        volume, and modulation. By moving her hand in different ways, Sonami can
        generate a wide range of sounds and manipulate them in real-time during
        her performances. This innovative instrument allows Sonami to engage
        with her audience in a unique and captivating manner, as they can
        witness the correlation between her gestures and the resulting sounds.
        Through the Lady's Glove, Laetitia Sonami showcases the potential for
        technology to enhance artistic expression and expand the possibilities
        of live electronic music performances. It remains a pioneering example
        of the fusion of art, technology, and the human body in the realm of
        experimental music.

      <h2>How is our project different & impactful?</h2>
      <p>
        Our project stands out by emphasizing an intimate interaction between
        machine and human as a core element. It offers a unique and impactful
        experience by providing an immersive and solitary space when individuals
        can share a moment with themselves and the machine.
